Nice to meet you, my name is **Savreen Samra**!

## My Coding Experience: ##
Switching to Computer Science after spending half a decade studying Kinesiology, I was scared. Coding was brand new to me and seemed so intimidating. 

However, within my first few months of studying Computer Science, I fell in love with it. 

The **joy I gained everytime I solved a complex problem** made me keep reaching for more and more problems, even though it can get challenging and even frustrating at times.  
<br>

> This is to say, **it is never too late to learn something, especially coding!** 
>
> I chose to go through the traditional route and pursue a degree, but there are numerous online resources. **Create what it most interesting to you, and you will eventually gain all the knowledge you need**, so explore and have fun with it!
